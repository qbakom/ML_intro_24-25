With these changes, the script now integrates both advanced diagnostics and AutoML. Here's what the modifications do:

AutoML Integration:

Added command line arguments for AutoML: --use_automl, --automl_backend, and --automl_time_budget
Added a new branch in the main function that runs AutoML if requested, using the advanced_diagnostics.py module
Creates a pipeline incorporating the AutoML model with preprocessing steps
Advanced Diagnostics:

Added a --advanced_diagnostics command line option
Integrated the diagnostic capabilities from advanced_diagnostics.py when enabled
Runs Yellowbrick visualizations and SHAP analysis on the trained model
Saves all diagnostics to a subdirectory in the output directory
Extended PCA Visualization:

Enhanced the PCA visualization to show classes by color
Added a colorbar for better interpretation
Better Pipeline Management:

Created a unified approach to handle the final pipeline regardless of whether it's standard, ensemble, or AutoML
Improved error handling when modules aren't available
These changes make the script more powerful and flexible, allowing users to choose between standard models, ensembles, or AutoML approaches, and to get advanced diagnostic information about model performance and feature importance.
